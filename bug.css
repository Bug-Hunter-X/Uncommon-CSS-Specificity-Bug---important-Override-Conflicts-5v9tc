The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  font-size: 16px;
}

p {
  font-size: 18px;
}

div p {
  font-size: 14px !important;
}
```

The `!important` declaration overrides the specificity of the `div p` selector, resulting in a font size of 14px for paragraphs within divs.  However, if there's another style rule targeting `div p` with equal or higher specificity (without `!important`), it might unexpectedly fail to override this, leading to unexpected results.  The `!important` flag is generally discouraged because it can make CSS difficult to maintain and debug.

# Uncommon CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in CSS related to specificity and the use of the `!important` flag.  The bug arises from unexpected interactions between specificity rules and the `!important` declaration when multiple styles target the same element.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code, while `solution.css` offers a solution that avoids the use of `!important` and ensures predictable style application.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.css` to observe the conflicting styles.
3. Observe the unexpected behavior in a browser or testing environment. 
4. Compare with the solution provided in `solution.css`.

## Solution

The solution focuses on resolving the specificity conflict without resorting to `!important` by using more targeted selectors and potentially adjusting the CSS cascade for better maintainability. Refer to `solution.css` for the corrected CSS.
